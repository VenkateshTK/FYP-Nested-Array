# FYP-Nested-Array
The work involves understanding the basics of DOA estimation like MUSIC and have implemented 2 latest algorithms in 2-D DOA estimation of Two Parallel Nested Array.

## Repo info
* The codes of 2 papers of Two Parallel Nested Array is TPNA2020 and TPNA2019 folders.
* The resources and plots are in the respective named folders.
* Basic codes like MUSIC of ULA ,UCA and nested array are in ULA music , UCA and NestedArray_1D folders.
* The random variations which we tested are in Random tries folder.
